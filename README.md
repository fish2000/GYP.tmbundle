# GYP.tmbundle
A TextMate bundle for the Python-based <a href="https://gyp.gsrc.io">GYP build tool</a> (née “Generate Your Project”). Based on <a href="https://github.com/vidmaker/gyp-sublime-text">a TextMate language grammar</a> originally by <a href="https://github.com/vidmaker">vidmaker</a>; it also packages <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/gyp/+/master/tools/pretty_gyp.py">this GYP-file pretty-print tool</a> as a bundle command.

# Installing
Download the <a href="https://github.com/fish2000/GYP.tmbundle/archive/master.zip">ZIP archive</a>, decompress, rename the folder from e.g. `GYP.tmbumdle-master` to `GYP.tmbundle` – the Finder will warn you about editing a file suffix, pay it no mind – and double-click on what should have just changed from a plain folder to a TextMate bundle icon. TextMate will open, if it hasn’t already, and ask you if you’d like to install the GYP bundle (which presumably you do).
